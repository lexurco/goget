goget is yet another tool like wget, ftp, or curl, written in Go with
two goals in mind:

- support parallel downloads
- support as many protocols as possible

At the moment, the utility doesn't actually do much. You can compile it
with `go build .', and then download files over http like so:

	./goget -p $number_of_parallels example.com \
	    http://example.com/file1 https://examlpe.com/file2
